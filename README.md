## Overview

### The challenge

- A functional tic-tac-toe 2 players game.
- Multiple JavaScript files.
- Clip-paths figures designed by myself
- Animations in cells when user clicks on them.
- Show the player for each movement with its own figure.
- Stop the game when there's no more movement and block them when there's a winner.
- A button to restart the game when user wants.

### Stage üèó

I'm working on improving this game adding some more functionalities and refactoring the code.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Animations
- JavaScript
- React
- classNames

### What I learned

I made my first clip-path and refreshed my JavaScript (conditional operators, arrays and loops mostly) and React skills.
I worked with the "classNames" JavaScript utility for conditionally joining classNames together which allowed me to have a shorter and more optimized code.
